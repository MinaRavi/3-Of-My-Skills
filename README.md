**Global Superstore - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
This project showcases an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Global Superstore dataset, aiming to uncover insights and present findings visually.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- `numpy`: Numerical computations.
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and preparation.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`: Data visualization and trend analysis.
  
## Analysis Overview

### 1. **Data Loading and Overview**
- Loaded the dataset and explored structure, types, and summary statistics.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Handled missing values, renamed columns, removed duplicates, and ensured consistency.

### 3. **Exploratory Analysis**
- Sales & Profit Analysis: Trends, metrics, and time-series visualizations.
- Regional Performance: Sales and profit by region.
- Category Analysis: Performance across categories and subcategories.
- Customer Segmentation: Patterns in sales, profit, and behavior.
  
### 4. **Data Visualization**
- Used bar plots, line plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots to present insights.

### 5. **Insights and Findings**
- Seasonal sales trends, high-performing regions, and key customer behavior patterns.

## 2. SQL Project

[![SQL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f93b827-992f-4ae5-a25c-528e9d2a61b6)](https://github.com/MinaRavi/3-Of-My-Skills/blob/main/SQL)

**Description:** This project showcases my ability to work with SQL databases. It includes creating database schemas, writing proper queries, and performing data analysis tasks.

**Key Features:**
- Database schema design
- Data insertion and updates
- Fixinag missing values, duplicates and wrong formatting
- Finding insights through data analysis
  


## 3. Dashboard Project

[![Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f503d4fa-087e-4792-851d-d564f44e60e0)](https://github.com/MinaRavi/3-Of-My-Skills/blob/main/Dashboard)

**Description:** In this project, I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize data insights. The dashboard provides users with an simple interface to explore and analyze data.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive data visualizations
- User-friendly interface
- Story-telling with data


## Dataset

- The [Global Super Store dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apoorvaappz/global-super-store-dataset) contains sales, profit, and shipping data for a fictional retail store operating globally.
- Includes information on customer orders, product categories, regions, and time trends (2012‚Äì2015).
- Ideal for analyzing sales performance, profitability, and return rates.
- Well-structured data, suitable for dashboard creation and advanced data analysis tasks.
